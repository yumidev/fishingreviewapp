## Comment
- First time to make an application from the scratch. While building this application, I realized that everytime I got stuck, instructor's way of thinking helped me to find the way to get over those points. Especially testing through console, debugging, breaking down the steps and clarifying each steps with writing and rewriting pseudo code. It was a good chance to go through all those steps and make it my own habits. Thanks to Jack, Kane, Sheriff and all of my classmates who shows me the way to solve many problems everyday.
